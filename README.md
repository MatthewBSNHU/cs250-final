How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Since we are in direct communication with the customer, throught the product owner, we can listen to their needs directly and that way satisfy whatever it was they asked from us for this project. Creating user stories is fundamental to support the project, because it is a part of our users that we are using to build together this puzzle piece that is the project in whole. 
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
The approach taken to developing programs should be continous integration and continous development, involving all of the team's work which are core principles of agile. Practices in agile for development should include story pointing, generating user stories, identifing sprint length and planning. 
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development? 
It means that you are proactive in every stage of developing the program, full hands on and that your role in the software development process reaches other parts of the project too and contributing to the team in more ways than just doing your workload.
